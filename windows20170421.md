# 列表视图
使用列表视图，用户可以使用单选或多选择来查看和与数据对象集合进行交互。

列表视图比列表框具有更多的灵活性和功能。与列表框不同，它们支持更改视图，分组，带标题的多个列，按列排序，更改列宽和顺序，作为拖动源或放置目标，以及从剪贴板复制数据。

## 什么情况下选择使用列表视图

列表框和列表视图的区别：

 ||列表框|列表视图|
 |--- |--- |---|
 |数据类型|Both data and program options.|Data only.|
 |内容|	Labels only.|Labels and auxiliary data, possibly in multiple columns.|
 |交互|Used for making selections.|Can be used for making selections, but often used for displaying and interacting with data. Can be a drag source or a drop target.|
|展现|Fixed|Users can change views, group, sort by columns, and change column widths and order.



 - Does the list present data, rather than program options? If not, consider using a list box instead.
 - Do users need to change views, group, sort by columns, or change column widths and order? If not, use a list box instead.
 - Does the control need to be a drag source or a drop target? If so, use a list view.
 - Do the list items need to be copied to or pasted from the clipboard? If so, use a list view.
 - Is the control used to choose zero or more items from a list of data? To choose one item, use single selection instead.
 - Is multiple selection essential to the task or commonly used? If so, use a check box list view to make multiple selection obvious, especially if your target users aren't advanced. If not, use a standard multiple-selection list view if the check boxes would draw too much attention to multiple selection or result in too much screen clutter.
 - Is the stability of the multiple selection important? If so, use a check box list, list builder, or add/remove list because clicking changes only a single item at a time. With a standard multiple selection list, it's very easy to clear all the selections—even by accident.

 - list
 
In List mode, this view orders items in columns and uses a horizontal scrollbar. By contrast, the icon view modes order items in rows and use a vertical scrollbar.

  - detail（详细式）
  
Each item appears as a row in a tabular format. The leftmost column contains both the item's optional icon and label, and the subsequent columns contain additional information, such as item properties.

### 列表视图变体

 - 列选择器
 
List views sometimes have so many columns that it isn't practical to show them all. In this case, the best approach is to display the most useful columns by default and allow users to add or remove columns as needed.
Right-clicking the column heading displays a context menu that allows users to add or remove columns.

 - 复选框视图
 
Allow users to select multiple items.
Multiple-selection list views have exactly the same appearance as single-selection list views, so there is no visual clue that they support multiple selection. A check box list view can be used to clearly indicate that multiple selection is possible. Consequently, this pattern should be used for tasks where multiple selection is essential or commonly used.
