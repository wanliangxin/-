# 列表视图
使用列表视图，用户可以使用单选或多选择来查看和与数据对象集合进行交互。

列表视图比列表框具有更多的灵活性和功能。与列表框不同，它们支持更改视图，分组，带标题的多个列，按列排序，更改列宽和顺序，作为拖动源或放置目标，以及从剪贴板复制数据。

## 什么情况下选择使用列表视图

列表框和列表视图的区别：

 ||列表框|列表视图|
 |--- |--- |---|
 |数据类型|Both data and program options.|Data only.|
 |内容|	Labels only.|Labels and auxiliary data, possibly in multiple columns.|
 |交互|Used for making selections.|Can be used for making selections, but often used for displaying and interacting with data. Can be a drag source or a drop target.|
|展现|Fixed|Users can change views, group, sort by columns, and change column widths and order.|


 - Does the list present data, rather than program options? If not, consider using a list box instead.
 - Do users need to change views, group, sort by columns, or change column widths and order? If not, use a list box instead.
 - Does the control need to be a drag source or a drop target? If so, use a list view.
 - Do the list items need to be copied to or pasted from the clipboard? If so, use a list view.
 - Is the control used to choose zero or more items from a list of data? To choose one item, use single selection instead.
 - Is multiple selection essential to the task or commonly used? If so, use a check box list view to make multiple selection obvious, especially if your target users aren't advanced. If not, use a standard multiple-selection list view if the check boxes would draw too much attention to multiple selection or result in too much screen clutter.
 - Is the stability of the multiple selection important? If so, use a check box list, list builder, or add/remove list because clicking changes only a single item at a time. With a standard multiple selection list, it's very easy to clear all the selections—even by accident.
