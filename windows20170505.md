# progress disclosure controls（逐步发现控件）

通过逐步披露控制，用户可以显示或隐藏附加信息，包括数据，选项或命令。逐步披露通过关注必要的，但是根据需要揭示更多的细节来促进简单化。

## 是正确的控件吗？

 - Do users need to see the information in some but not all scenarios, or some but not all of the time?
 - If the information is displayed by default, are users ever likely to choose to hide it? Are there scenarios where users will need more space? Are users sufficiently motivated to customize the user interface (UI)? If not, display the information without using progressive disclosure.
 - Is the additional information advanced, substantial, complex, or related to an independent subtask? If so, consider displaying the information in a separate window using command buttons or links instead of using a progressive disclosure control. (Additional information is advanced if it is intended for advanced users. It's complex if it makes other information hard to read or lay out.)
 - Is the additional information a sentence or sentence fragment that describes what an item does or how it can be used? If so, consider using a tooltip or infotip.
 - Is the additional information related to the current task, but independent of the currently displayed information? If so, consider using tabs instead. However, collapsible lists are often preferable to tabs because they are more flexible and scalable.
 - Is showing or hiding the additional information essentially a data filter? If so, consider using a drop-down list or check boxes instead to apply the filter to the entire list.
